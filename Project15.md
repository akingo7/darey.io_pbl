# AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

### AWS Cloud Project

- I created Organization in my AWS Account. Created Organization Unit named "Dev" Then I added a new account to the organization with the name DevOps which I created with another email address which I used for this project and moved the new account "DevOps" to Dev organization unit.

- I created a free Domain Name ("gabrieldevops.ml") from freenom.com, created aws hosted zone then map the nameserver from freenom to AWS hosted zone so that I can use aws as the Domain name server.
