# WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS PROJECT 6

#### This project is written with Ubuntu 20.04 as the host machine and RHEL-8.4.0 as the remote server on AWS

I launched 2 instances on AWS where one will be the web server and the other is the database which is the setup on *3-tier architecture* which include client side, server side and the database, Then I created 3 10g volume on aws which I attached to a machine each.
